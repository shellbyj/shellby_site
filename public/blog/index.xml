      <title>Population Growth Rates</title>

      <description>1. Calculate dN/NdtAnnual population data provides some initial population size at some year (t) and subsequent population sizes for each year afterwards. With these quantities, you can calculate the logistic per capita growth rate of a population when you take the natural log of the population size (at one year in the future) divided by the initial population size.
Manual Calculation of dN/Ndt from 1963-1964 for each of the 5 countries.</description>

Data was collected from 1999-2012 and obtained from the Long Term Ecological Research portal.I’m interested in seeing if there is a relationship between age and snowshoe hare weight (g) and hindfoot value (metadata indicated that this variable was a dimensionless real number).</description>

This markdown document contains code that explores nutritional variables related to vegetables and vegetable products. Data was sourced from the USDA National Nutrient Database (also known as Food Data Central). I will be exploring the correlation between several nutrients within this particular food group (i.e. energy, vitamin A, carbohydrates, etc). To explore this, a principal components Analysis (PCA) was completed.</description>
