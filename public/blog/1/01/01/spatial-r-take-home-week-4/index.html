<h3>8. How to create an ‘sf’ object from lat/long recordings (e.g. in an excel file)</h3>
<p>Make a mock dataset using tribble():</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_example &lt;- tribble(
  ~id, ~lon, ~lat,# column names 
  &quot;tiger&quot;, -119.4, 34.35, #creating the first row
  &quot;lion&quot;, -11.41, 34.39,
  &quot;bear&quot;, -119.43, 34.38
)


#just becasue you put lat/long into a new dataset does not mean that R automatically recognizes it as spatial data

#Convert to a spatial &#39;sf&#39; object:

animals_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(my_example, coords = c(&quot;lon&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;), crs = 4326)</code></pre>
<p>Make a map using tmap:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>animal_map &lt;- tm_basemap(&quot;Stamen.Watercolor&quot;) +
  tm_shape(animals_sf) +
  tm_dots(labels = &quot;id&quot;, col = &quot;purple&quot;,
