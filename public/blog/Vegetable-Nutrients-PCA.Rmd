####This markdown document contains code that explores nutritional variables related to vegetables and vegetable products. Data was sourced from the USDA National Nutrient Database (also known as Food Data Central). I will be exploring the correlation between several nutrients within this particular food group (i.e. energy, vitamin A, carbohydrates, etc). To explore this, a principal components Analysis (PCA) was completed.

*******************


```{r}

#Read in data

food_nutrients<- read_csv("usda_nutrients.csv")


#Use unique() to see what all the possible food groups are listed in the dataset
unique(food_nutrients$FoodGroup)

#Clean up the column names and choose variables of interest (in this case, veggies): 

veggies_clean <- food_nutrients %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(food_group == "Vegetables and Vegetable Products") %>% 
  select(energy_kcal:vit_c_mg)

```

*******************

####Before attempting a PCA, lets check to see if there are any NA values so that the PCA will run.

```{r}

#Can use the summary function to get a text output that will list all variables and NAs associated with them

summary(veggies_clean)

#gg_miss_var() makes it a little easier to tell by creating a graphical output.
gg_miss_var(veggies_clean)

#No missing values, so we're good to go.

```

*******************



```{r, }

#Let's try to run a PCA now. Using the function, prcomp()

veggies_pca<- prcomp(veggies_clean, scale. = TRUE)
veggies_pca

```

```{r}
veggies_biplot <- autoplot(veggies_pca,
                      colour = NA,
                      title = "Vegetable",
                      loadings.label = TRUE,
                      loadings.label.size = 3,
                      loadings.label.colour = "black",
                      loadings.label.repel = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal()

veggies_biplot

```


**Figure 1.** **Principal Components Analysis Biplot.** Biplot visualizing the amount of variance described by 10 nutritional variables related to vegetables.

*******************


####According to the bi-plot, for certain nutrients in vegetable or vegetable products, the following can be concluded:


-The amount of protein and carbohydrates is highly positively correlated.

-The amount of carbs and energy provided from veggies is positively correlated.

-Vitamin B12 describes the least amount of variance in the PC1 direction.

-Most of the variance is described in PC1.

-The amount of vitamin A in a veggie product is negatively correlated with the energy recieved from a vegetable product.

-However, vitamin c is very positively correlated with vitamin a.
