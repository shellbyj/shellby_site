<h4>This markdown document contains code that explores nutritional variables related to vegetables and vegetable products. Data was sourced from the USDA National Nutrient Database (also known as Food Data Central). I will be exploring the correlation between several nutrients within this particular food group (i.e.Â energy, vitamin A, carbohydrates, etc). To explore this, a principal components Analysis (PCA) was completed.</h4>

<h4>According to the bi-plot, for certain nutrients in vegetable or vegetable products, the following can be concluded:</h4>
<p>-The amount of protein and carbohydrates is highly positively correlated.</p>
<p>-The amount of carbs and energy provided from veggies is positively correlated.</p>
<p>-Vitamin B12 describes the least amount of variance in the PC1 direction.</p>
<p>-Most of the variance is described in PC1.</p>
<p>-The amount of vitamin A in a veggie product is negatively correlated with the energy recieved from a vegetable product.</p>
<p>-However, vitamin c is very positively correlated with vitamin a.</p>
